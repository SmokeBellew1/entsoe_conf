The Renewables Grid Initiative (RGI) promotes 100% integration of electricity produced from renewable energy sources. TSOs and NGOs join forces in RGI to support the build-up of a sufficient grid infrastructure in Europe for both decentralised and large-scale renewable energy sources. RGI's 2nd annual 'Good practice of the year' award will be announced on 19 November during the pre-conference dinner.

The Energy Community is about investments, economic development, security of energy supply and social stability; but – more than this – the Energy Community is also about solidarity, mutual trust and peace. The very existence of the Energy Community, only ten years after the end of the Balkan conflict, is a success in itself, as it stands as the first common institutional project undertaken by the non-European Union countries of South East Europe.
