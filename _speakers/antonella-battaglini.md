Antonella Battaglini is founder and Chief Executive Officer of the Renewables Grid Initiative.

In addition to RGI's activities, she is also one of the expert members of the Global Agenda Council on the Future of Electricity of the World Economic Forum (WEF) and a senior scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) where she leads the SuperSmart Grid (SSG) process, a concept she developed together with her team to reconcile different approaches to renewables. 

By adopting a holistic approach, the SSG addresses the challenges of the transformation of the power sector considering generation, transmission and demand management. In this concept both centralized and decentralized generation play an undisputed role.
