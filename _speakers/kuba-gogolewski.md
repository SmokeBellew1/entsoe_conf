Kuba Gogolewski has a MSc in Economics from the Warsaw School of Economics in Poland. Before joining CEE Bankwatch Network
(www.bankwatch.org) in January 2011 he worked as a researcher for Greenpeace Poland and cooperated closely with Greenpeace India in 2009 and 2010. During and after his studies he spent long periods abroad, among others in Spain, Mexico and India.

He coordinated a campaign focusing on coal and fossil fuel projects in Poland in the 2011-2013 period and engaged actively in the energy policy revisions of the European Investment Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in 2012 and 2013. Since the end of 2013 he is a project coordinator of the EU funded project focusing on the MENA region and the activities of European finance institutions in the Arab Spring countries at CEE Bankwatch and an active energy campaigner based in Brussels.

Kuba is a father of a 7 month old Iris and strives for a future that would allow her to have as much satisfaction in life as he had until now and the big part of the effort is campaigning and engaging with decision-makers to ensure drastically increased levels of action resulting in the transformation away from the economy based on fossil fuels.
