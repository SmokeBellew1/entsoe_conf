## Daily Media Review – 12 June 2015
_Dear colleagues, 

Here is today’s edition of the Daily Media Review about what is in the news on electricity in Europe, and the place of ENTSO-E in the media.

Have a nice day,

Best regards,

Julien Decré_

### 1.	What’s New on Energy in Europe Today?
There are some important news to be noticed today, including: the disappointing results of the UN conference in Bonn – including poor commitments from our Serbian neighbour; the launch of an organised market for trading of capacity guarantees in France based on the capacity mechanism introduced by RTE; proposed changes to the regulatory regime for German energy networks; and the confirmation of the presence of European Commissioners Maroš Šefčovič and  Miguel Angel Arias Cañete at the upcoming IV ACER Annual Conference, which will focus on how to achieve ‘An Energy Union for Consumers.’

#### **Disappointment in Bonn**
The 10-day **conference in Bonn** ended yesterday with the **uninspiring decision to pick up the discussion again later this year**. Negotiators from 190 countries **could not agree on whether to acknowledge science in the text** that will serve as the basis for talks at the **COP21 summit in Paris**. The UN conference in Bonn ended Thursday with a brief statement saying talks on the issue will continue in November and December.

#### **Serbia’s climate action plan undermines prospects of its EU accession**
Yesterday, **Serbia has announced its contribution to the Paris climate agreement**. The emission reduction the country is planning to achieve are **far below the EU’s target**. According to Climate Action Network Europe, this **undermines prospects of Serbia’s EU accession**.

#### **New Exchange Council Approves Organised Secondary Market For Capacity Guarantees In France**
At its constituent meeting in Leipzig, the Members of the Exchange Council of **European Power Exchange** (EPEX SPOT) **elected Peter Heydecker** as their Chairman. “We are facing challenging developments in the electricity trading sector such as the **creation of the pan-European power market** and the increasing importance of **Intraday power trading**”, says Peter Heydecker, “I am very happy to further accompany these evolutions.” Moreover, the Exchange Council approved the **launch of an organised market for trading of capacity guarantees in France**. This market is based on the capacity mechanism introduced by the French Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy and the French electricity grid operator **RTE**.

#### **Assessing the impact of new German energy networks**
Proposed **changes to the regulatory regime for German energy networks** by sector regulator Bundesnetzagentur (BNetzA) will, if implemented, **improve transparency** and result in **more timely cost recovery for distribution system operators (DSOs)**, says Moody's. Overall, the proposals amount to an evolutionary adjustment designed to facilitate German energy networks' significant medium-term investment needs. The proposals have **limited implications for larger transmission system operators (TSOs)**, as they already have a mechanism that ensures timely recovery of network expansion investments.

#### **EC Vice-President Šefčovič and Commissioner Arias Cañete keynote speakers at ACER’s Annual Conference 2015**
**European Commission Vice-President for the Energy Union Maroš Šefčovič and Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy Miguel Angel Arias Cañete have confirmed their presence at the IV ACER Annual Conference**, which will focus on how to achieve **‘An Energy Union for Consumers”**. The event will take place at the Brdo Congress Centre near Kranj, Slovenia, on Thursday, 9th July 2015. In the wake of the publication of the European Commission’s Energy Union strategy, the ACER Annual Conference will aim to **identify the benefits** that this strategy will be able to deliver **to EU energy consumers**.

### **2.	ENTSO-E in the Media**

A little reminder of yesterday’s breaking news, for those who may have missed it:

#### **Turkey's TEIAS increases ENTSO-E cross-border capacity**
The **Turkish grid operator TEIAS has increased the interconnection capacity with Bulgaria and Greece by 100MW**, a source at the operator told ICIS on Wednesday. The **long-term agreement signed between TEIAS and ENTSO-E** marked the end of a five-year trial period for Turkey, opening up the **opportunity for the country to become an observer state and possibly a full ENTSO-E member in the near future**.
