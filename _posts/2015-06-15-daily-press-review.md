## Daily Media Review – 15 June 2015

_Dear colleagues,_ 

_Here is today’s edition of the Daily Media Review about what is in the news on electricity in Europe, and the place of ENTSO-E in the media._

_Have a nice day,_

_Best regards,_ 

_Julien Decré_

### 1.	What’s in the News on Electricity in Europe Today? 
On the menu of the day, one may retain: a new – quite optimistic – report from the IEA on global energy emissions prospects; the completion of the installation of a new cable linking Lithuania and Sweden’s transmission systems; the liberalisation of Ukraine’s energy market; and the release of a brand new On/Off grid-inverter that could improve the usefulness of solar power systems and make them more competitive compared with fossil fuel and other types of renewable energy

#### **IEA: Energy emissions can peak 10 years early, if fossil fuels targeted**
Global energy emissions could peak as early as 2020 but **only if governments worldwide phase out fossil fuels subsidies and ban the building of new coal power stations**, a report published today (15 June) by the International Energy Agency (IEA) has said.

#### **NordBalt cable laying works in Baltic Sea finished**
The Topaz Installer cable laying vessel **has finished her work**. In just a year and two months, with short interruptions, she laid 400 kilometres of NordBalt cable onto the bottom of the Baltic Sea. **90 percent of the link construction works have already been completed**, reports energy company Litgrid. "We are successfully pursuing our main goal - **to be connected to the Northern Europe** where the largest European power market operates by 1 January 2016. **Lithuania imports about two thirds of the consumed electricity**, so the opportunity to purchase more electricity from Scandinavia, which is rich in hydro resources, will provide the pre-conditions for **lowering the price of wholesale electricity**. In Lithuania this power connection will become the synonym of opportunities to choose, competition and cooperation in electricity energy sector," said Daivis Virbickas, CEO and Board Chairman of **Litgrid**, the **Lithuanian electricity transmission system operator**.

#### **Ukraine removes mandatory local content requirement: a boost for renewable energy investments**
Upon legal action initiated by the Energy Community Secretariat, the Ukrainian Parliament last week voted to** remove the so-called local content clause in the Electricity Law of Ukraine**. Under this clause, the eligibility for feed-in tariffs for investments in renewable energy depended on the fulfillment of minimum shares of goods and works of Ukrainian origin. Instead, the Law adopted last week entitles investors fulfilling certain local content quota to a bonus on top of the existing feed-in tariff, thus **replacing a strict barrier to market access by a more differentiated instrument** for supporting the development of the Ukrainian manufacturing and service industries.

#### **CyboEnergy releases On/Off-grid inverter and will demonstrate at Intersolar North America**
CyboEnergy, Inc. (Rancho Cordova, CA), the developer of the world's first solar power Mini-Inverter that possesses the key merits of both central inverters and microinverters, announced today that the company has released a ground-breaking On/Off Grid CyboInverter that **can operate in either on-grid or off-grid mode, switching between the two modes automatically depending on the grid condition**. CyboEnergy will demonstrate the new product at Intersolar (Booth 8721) on July 14-16, 2015 in San Francisco, California. **Using the On/Off-Grid CyboInverter, the same solar power system can generate power to the grid and can also be a power backup system when the grid is down**.  In addition, the unique multiple input channel design of the CyboInverter product family offers **seamless integration of renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, fuel-cell, hydro, and batteries where energy storage is desirable**. The On/Off-Grid CyboInverter can significantly **improve the usefulness of solar power systems and make them more competitive compared with fossil fuel and other types of renewable energy**, resulting in better return-on-investment (ROI) and faster adoption of solar energy in the global market.

### 2.	ENTSO-E in the Media

ENTSO-E’s data has been quoted to illustrate an article about the context of increased tensions in the Baltic Sea that surrounds the construction of a cable linking Lithuanian and Swedish transmission systems. 

#### **Regional Tensions Surround Baltic Sea Submarine Electric Transmission Project**
This epic project, given its regional configuration, gives a fascinating glimpse into the political tension in the region. An undersea power cable aimed at **reducing the Baltic states’ energy dependence on Russia** has emerged as the latest **point of friction** in a region increasingly enveloped in a Cold War atmosphere. **Sweden and Lithuania**, which are at either end of the proposed submarine electric transmission system, **have complained that Russian warships have repeatedly interrupted the installation**.  The latest such incident, the third in two months, occurred last week when the Russian Navy ordered a vessel involved in the cable-laying work to leave the area, according to Sweden and Lithuania. Although the vessel was in Lithuania’s exclusive economic zone, it was sent away for as long as 10 hours.
